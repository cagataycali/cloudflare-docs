# Workers for Platforms

{{<description>}}

Workers for Platforms is built on top of [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). Workers for Platforms extends the capabilities of Cloudflare Workers to SaaS businesses that want to deploy Worker scripts on behalf of their customers or let their users write Worker scripts directly.

{{</description>}}

{{<plan type="enterprise">}}

Workers for Platforms allows you to:

* Run your own code as a wrapper around your users' code.
* Logically group your code separately from your usersâ€™ code.
* Create custom routing logic.
* Use additional APIs like script tags for bulk operations.
* Surpass Workers' 500 script/account limit.
